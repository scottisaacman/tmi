Three Mile Island Dauphin County Cancer Investigation

I noticed a high rate of cancer among residents and former residents of Dauphin County, Pennsylvania.  
This was my home and home to the Three mile Island nuclear power plant. Every class reunion, our numbers thin and the classmates
with cancer increases.
Checking with the Pennsylvania Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control, confirmed my suspicion about abnormal cancer
rates.  The statistics used by the health departments likely undercount the true numbers because many residents move out after
completing high school.  
I'm collecting data to compare the local rates with the US average rates to determine if the numbers exceed what might be expected
by statistical variance and, if so, by what significance.
